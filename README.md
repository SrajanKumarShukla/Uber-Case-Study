## Uber Supply Demand Gap

**The data set used for analysis  data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle.The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation.**

In this project Supply Demand Gap is identified for Uber using EDA in both Python and Tableau.
The Steps for analysis are as follows:
* Load the dataset into a dataframe.
* Perform Data Inspection and  Data Cleaning on the dataframe.
* Exploratoratory Data Analysis is done on the dataframe.
* Plots are created to visualize the important attributes and how they contribute to the supply demand gap in Python as well as Tableau.
* Final Results and recommendations are provided in the form of PDF with self explanatory plots.
